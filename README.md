# arrowey   
An easy, 2D esolang made from an almost-unreadable scripting language, both implemented in this repo.   
*Do not clone the repo to try to run arrowey in a production environment, the code **will** have problems and **will** crash sometimes because it is between versions!* If you wish to run arrowey, check out the releases page.   

   
*NOTE: I'm very irregularly working on this project as I don't always have time for it because of school...*
