# arrowey   
An easy, 2D esolang made from an almost-unreadable programming language, both implemented in this repo.   
*Do not clone the repo to try to run arrowey in a production environment, the code **will** have problems and 
**will** crash sometimes because it is between versions!* If you wish to run arrowey, check out the releases page.   

There isn't really a "spec", there's only this implementation of arrowey, the spec is in my head. 
I'll write documentation later on, at first I want to get it into working shape 
(i.e. at least most syntax implemented in the parser and first run of a basic I/O and arithmetics program).   

   
*NOTE: I'm very irregularly working on this project as I don't always have time for it because of school...*
