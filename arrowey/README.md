# arrowey
Don't like JavaScript? You're welcome to the GrassFox network, where JavaScript is replaced by my own programming 
language, arrowey. Initially I created it as an esolang, but now its purpose has shifted to be a strange but usable JS 
replacement. And it has although non-mandatory) type hints that, if present, actually are enforced (no type hint just 
means "type any")!   
arrowey is developed in its own repo, on [Lampe2020/arrowey](https://github.com/Lampe2020/arrowey).
